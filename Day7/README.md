# 📘 Day 6 — Object-Oriented Programming in Python


***Welcome to Day 6 of the Python learning journey 🚀.***

Today, we focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as classes, objects, constructors, methods, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

***📂 Programs Covered***

1.Write a program to create a simple class Car with attributes and methods.

2.Write a program with a constructor to initialize object values.

3.Demonstrate the difference between instance methods, class methods, and static methods.

4.Create a class with public, protected, and private members and access them.

5.Demonstrate Single Inheritance with an example.

6.Demonstrate Multiple Inheritance with an example.

7.Demonstrate Polymorphism by overriding a method in the child class.

***📝 Topics Learned***

1.Classes & Objects → Blueprints to create objects.

2.Constructor (__init__) → Special method to initialize object data.

3.Instance Method → Works with object attributes.

4.Class Method → Works with class-level data (@classmethod).

5.Static Method → Independent utility functions (@staticmethod).

6.Encapsulation → Public, Protected, and Private members.

7.Inheritance → Reuse and extend functionality.

8.Polymorphism → Different implementations of the same method.

***⚡ By the end of Day 6 ⚡***

you’ll have a solid understanding of Python OOP and be ready to use it in real projects.
