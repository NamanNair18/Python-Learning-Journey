#ðŸ“… Day 2 â€“ Python Basics (Strings & Lists)

##ðŸŽ¯ Goal  
Be confident in handling **strings** and **lists**, performing operations like slicing, concatenation, iteration, and basic problem-solving without relying too much on built-in shortcuts.

##âœ… Step 2: Coding Questions

### ðŸ”¹ String Practice
1. Take a string input from the user and print its **first and last character**.  
2. Write a program to **reverse a string** without using built-in functions.  
3. Check if a string is a **palindrome**.  
4. Write a program to **count vowels and consonants** in a string.  
5. Given a string, count the **frequency of each character**.  

### ðŸ”¹ List Practice
6. Create a list of 5 integers. Print the **sum and average** of all elements.  
7. Count how many times a given element occurs in a list.  
8. Find the **maximum and minimum element** in a list without using `max()` or `min()`.  
9. Concatenate two lists and **remove duplicates**.  
10. Rotate a list by `k` positions.  
11. Find the **second largest element** in a list.

##âœ… Day 2 Completed:  
By the end of today, you should feel confident with:  
- String manipulation (indexing, slicing, looping)  
- List operations (traversal, updating, removing duplicates)  
- Solving problems without relying on built-in shortcuts
