# ðŸ“˜ Day 4 â€“ Python Basics (Loops)

***ðŸŽ¯ Goal***  
Be confident in using `for` and `while` loops to repeat tasks, iterate over ranges, and build logic that requires repetition.

***âœ… Step 2: Practice Questions***

1. Print all numbers from 1 to 20 using a `for` loop.  
2. Print the multiplication table of a number entered by the user.  
3. Print the sum of first **N** natural numbers (user input N).  
4. Print all even numbers between 1 and 50.  
5. Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number.  
6. Create a simple number guessing game (hint: use `while` loop until user guesses correctly).

***ðŸ’¡ Tips***  
- Use `range(start, end)` with `for` loops.  
- Use `while` when you donâ€™t know how many times to repeat.  
- Break down big problems into smaller steps.
