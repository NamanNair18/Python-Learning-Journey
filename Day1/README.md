# ðŸ“… Day 1 â€“ Python Basics (Data Types & Variables)

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal  
Be fully confident with **variables, input/output, and primitive data types** in Python.  

---

## âœ… Step 1: Study Material (30â€“40 min)  
- ðŸ“– **Read:** [Python Variables â€“ W3Schools]
- ðŸ“¹ **Watch (Optional):**  
  - [CodeWithHarry â€“ Python Data Types (Hindi)]  
  - [Programming with Mosh â€“ Python for Beginners (English)]
- ðŸ“‘ **Cheat Sheet:** [Python Data Types & Variables â€“ Programiz]

## âœ… Step 2: Coding Questions  
1. Create 3 variables (`name`, `age`, `cgpa`) and print them in a single line.  
2. Take input from user: their favorite color, then print `"Your favorite color is X"`.  
3. Swap values of two variables (without using a third variable).  
4. Create 3 variables of types: `int`, `float`, `string`. Print their types using `type()`.  
5. Take two numbers from user and print their **sum, difference, product, and quotient**.  
6. Create a variable `x = 5`. Convert it into: `float`, `string`, and `boolean`.  
7. Write a program to calculate **Simple Interest** (Input: principal, rate, time).  
8. Take the radius of a circle as input and print its **area** and **circumference**.  
9. A shopkeeper gives 18% GST on a product. Take cost price as input, calculate 
    **final price including GST**.  
10. A user enters their **name and age**. Print:  
   `"Hello <name>, you will turn 100 years old in the year <YYYY>"`.  


âœ… **Day 1 Completed:** Strong foundation in variables, input/output, and primitive data types.
