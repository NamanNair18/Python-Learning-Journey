# 🌟 Day 7 – Python OOP (Inheritance & Polymorphism)

## 🎯 Goal  
Gain confidence in **Inheritance** (code reuse) and **Polymorphism** (flexible methods like overriding & operator overloading).  

---

## 📖 Step 1: Study Material (30–40 min)  

### 🔹 Read  
- [Python Inheritance – W3Schools]
- [Programiz – Inheritance in Python]
- [GeeksforGeeks – Polymorphism in Python]

### 🔹 Watch (Optional)  
- [Python Inheritance & Polymorphism Explained (English)]
- [CodeWithHarry – Python Inheritance (Hindi)]

---

## 📝 Step 2: Practice Questions  

1. Create a `Person` class and inherit a `Student` class from it. Add methods to show details.  
2. Demonstrate **single inheritance** and **multiple inheritance** with simple examples.  
3. Write a program to show **method overriding** (child class redefines parent’s method).  
4. Implement a **BankAccount** base class and inherit `SavingsAccount` and `CurrentAccount`.  
5. Show an example of **operator overloading** (`+` operator to add two objects).  
6. Create an example to demonstrate **polymorphism** using a common method across multiple classes.

## 💡 Tips  
- Use `super()` to call parent class methods.  
- **Polymorphism** = same method name, different behaviors.  
- Operator overloading = magic methods like `__add__`, `__str__`, `__len__`.

## ✅ Day 7 Completed  
You can now:  
✔ Build **class hierarchies**  
✔ Reuse code with **inheritance**  
✔ Write flexible programs using **polymorphism**
